      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Okay. Today, I have a chance to talk to somebody who I've been listening to for a long time. His name is Robin Rambo. Some people, many people will know him as scanner. That was an artist <span style="color:red"
          data-ts="13.86" data-end_ts="14.19" title="13.86" id=c_"13.86">__artists__</span> name that he's used for ages. I have, I mean, I remember way back when just completely geeking out on, on the releases that he had back when I was like a geek
        coder in a, in a cubicle in Milwaukee, I'd be sitting there just like totally flipping out at what this guy was, was putting out. And, his work continues to amaze and, and continues to be enjoyable. So I'm really excited to have him. I have a
        chance to talk with them on a podcast. So with no more to do let's talk to Robin. Hey Robin, how's it going? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin Rimbaud: </b>Hey, hello. Nice to be here.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>So great to have you, I don't want to come across like, too much of a super fan. I'm kind of a super fan, just because, you were a part of your work was a part of my life at a time when my ears and my brain was kind of
        expanding to take in a lot of different kind of musics and, and you were pushing it on envelope in a way that I needed in my life at that time. So I do appreciate that. But one of the things that I love is that, you know, right up to now, I
        am just completely enjoying the, the work that you're putting out. I just recently kind of did a scan through and was, was playing around with listening to some of your catalog. And I kinda got into the, to this the most releasing recently
        <span style="color:red" data-ts="100.62" data-end_ts="101.01" title="100.62" id=c_"100.62">__SIADH__</span> access to, which is the signal of a signal of a signal. It was just gorgeous stuff. Can you tell me a little bit about what your focus
        is, your artistic focuses right now and what kind of work that you're, you're really zeroing in on right now? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>It's a difficult question, isn't it? Because I mean, the one thing I've never done, if I can answer it in this way to begin with is follow the traditional model of how a creative person works. And there is a fairly traditional
      model, which is even the most exploratory artists seem to make some kind of a product, whether it's a sculpture or a photograph or a record or a CD, whatever it may be, and then release it in some fashion and then promote it. And that's usually
      the last thing I do. I tend to say yes to any projects that appear or conversations that open up where I have no idea what they're going to be. You know, so in the last 18 months, that's included projects that have been such things as working
      with the code of soil and working with an artist, looking at the pH levels in soil, throughout Europe and developing a project, which looks at the sound and the impact of the soil on our wellbeing and our lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>So that was a very big art project, which is actually still ongoing, actually going to be showing a version of it in Berlin and installation in the summer. And I think Denmark somewhere later this year, so those kinds of projects
      are always on the go. I am working on a VR project with a very large American computer company, which for the moment has been paused a huge pause button for lots of people. But that's a very exciting thing because that's working with the
      gigantic kind of ambitious idea with <span style="color:red" data-ts="207.97" data-end_ts="208.09" title="207.97" id=c_"207.97">__an__</span> Israeli artist and we're collaborating on a project that will be happening, but it's just kind of, as
      I say on that pause button, but you know, I'm drawn to making things that are, to be honest, that reach out to me in a sense in that they challenge me and I don't know quite what to do, but also they reach towards a new audience.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>So I'm always drawn to something which allows me to make something that suddenly there's people listing an experience in this work. They would never otherwise have heard, you know, so any opportunity to do that is appealing. So it
      may be a writer comes to me and says, Hey, I'm writing, Oh, I'm working on a novel, I'm writing an essay for, I had one, for example, for the economist magazine, a fairly, you know, innocuous magazine in a sense. And they came to me and said,
      we have a, an essay. So could you illustrate it with sound? So I thought, what a great idea. So not you don't just read the article online. If you're a subscriber or read the magazine, you actually get a chance to listen to it in a way. And
      those kinds of opportunity opportunities are really appealing because I, you know, I come in blind in a sense, and I'm not quite sure where they're going to go to.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>So when you ask me that question, you know, it's, my life usually depends upon an email from a stranger or a random conversation, or me inventing an idea. For example, I had an idea last week when I was sleeping and thought,
      wouldn't it be great in my, in my dream, I was walking on the sand by the water and I thought, wouldn't it be great if you had words printed on the soles of your shoes, and then you could walk through the sand and write, write different
      sentences. And if there was a group of you, you could actually rather like those fridge magnets, that lots of people have, they play these games. I thought, wouldn't it be fun if you could actually do that with your shoes. And then you could
      actually make all these different souls that you change with different words on. So that's how my dreams work sometimes. So, you know, ideas come from all manner of places. And, to answer a simple question, I don't know is usually my standard
      answer because I, you know, I never quite know what's happening next.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right. And it's interesting because that you say it that way, because whether it's following your exploits on, when they show up on social media, or if we go to scanner.dot com, which is kind of your, your blog feed or
        whatever, it actually could kind of be a full time job just trying to figure out what the hell you're doing, because you do have a lot of irons in the fire. And it does seem like, I dunno, on one hand it looks like it could be short attention
        span theater, because maybe you get like bored with one thing and you want to jump to the next, but I would say the other thing that's interesting is when, when you go and sample the different works, even when it's like broadly different
        stuff, there's always kind of a voice that sounds like you it's, your you're bringing yourself to these projects rather than just tiptoeing in someone else's garden, right? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you know, probably one of the strangest I've had in the last week was an invitation from a curator in San Francisco to design a mask for COVID-19, but to design a mask that reflects my own kind of aspect,
      my own approach. So I'm looking at a kind of surveillance mask, which actually hides your face. And actually, I mean, it's going to be a real mask. I'm not this, isn't just an imaginary thing. Somebody is actually making this, but it's going to
      be a mask that actually maps the movement of sound during your day in the, in the sort of material on the front of the mask. So it, it has <span style="color:red" data-ts="416.94" data-end_ts="417.03" title="416.94" id=c_"416.94">__a__</span>,
      a breathing apparatus that allows you to, you know, to breathe properly, but also protect you with a filter, but also actually hides your face. But actually from a certain angle, there are lines going through it, the map, the <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="427.92" data-end_ts="428.25" title="427.92" id=c_"427.92">__roots__</span> of your day, where you've been during the day. So in which with any raise at the end of the day, and then begin the next day. So it's a very
      playful thing, but in some ways, yes, it still connects with many ideas that fascinate me ideas of, you know, stories, ideas of voices, ideas of mapping the city, these kinds of things, which have been around in all my projects largely.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right, right. So true. And, in this kind of audio mapping, I mean, you know, the name scanner, it really does. It really does talk about your beginnings where you caught people's attention by grabbing information that was kind
        of like freely floating through the radio waves and utilizing that as sort of like source material. And it was interesting because it was like a really weird combination of a music and crept style assemble ODG, but also it was informed a lot
        by sort of hip hop and techno sampling techniques and all this kind of stuff, or at least at least that's the way I read it. It's, it's interesting that that has become sort of like a, maybe an almost emotional title line, even as you've
        moved into other sort of ways of expressing yourself. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>No, it's, it's, it's very, it's a very good response. I appreciate that because, you know, they, I remember arguing very early on with what I was doing in the sort of late eighties, early nineties was to suggest that even if you
      don't like this kind of work or you find it wrong, morally bankrupt in that I was listening to other people's mobile phone conversations and then recording them or broadcast to them during a live performance. But if anything, if it, if it
      brought to light the ideas and conversations about surveillance and conversations about and private in that that in itself could, could offer a validity to the work I've felt, you know, it wasn't necessarily to sell a product. I found at that
      time, what I was trying to do to be quite honest was I was using voices in works. I've made since I was a teenager.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And when I came across the scanner itself, I thought, wow, this is fantastic because I can get really good recordings of complete strangers and they'd be there. And they arrive to me without any history. I have no idea who these
      people are and therefore you have to kind of embed your own imagination around them and try and work out who they are, what their background is. And literally from the first moment, that always appealed to me, but I thought, you know, it,
      wasn't a very conscious decision. Hey, let me do something controversial. It was simply because it worked, the technology enabled this process to happen. I think, you know, you find that probably in lots of your conversations, you talk to
      people and you don't necessarily plan something out. It's just the conjunction of one or two things lead to a third thing. It's like a kind of science in a way.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>Yeah. And so yeah, that body of work still has a relevance. In fact, I would argue has just as much relevance today as it ever did. You know, we live in a strange society, you know, a quite unsettling moment at this, at this
      present time. And the very issues of kind of public and private space are ever more relevant. You know, smartphones back in the late eighties, early nineties were only really possessed by fairly wealthy people or your local drug dealer. And,
      today pretty much everybody that we know has one, but those conversations don't seem to exist anymore. The kind of vulnerability of, of private information, you know, people are still quite willing to give all their information away on social
      networks as we know and so on. So for me, I still find these kinds of conversations and ideas quite fascinating and relevant to our lives today.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right. That's, that's really, it. It's amazing to think of how, at the time, when you were, when you were, using a scanner to pull this stuff in a technology, first of all, was really open for you to be able to do that. I put
        second, but additionally, it was a time where a lot of people weren't really thinking too extensively about surveillance about privacy issues, or at least not nearly as much as we're confronted with today. You know, right now I, I live just
        outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota, which is sort of like ground central for some really, some really scary social and protest unrest and, sort of like the state, response to that, which, makes people extremely aware of the sort of
        surveillance state that exists. I mean, people, people in great Britain are already pretty familiar with the, with kind of the hundred percent camera coverage that exists in certain parts of the, of the country. I mean, it's, it's a scary
        state that we find ourselves in, but one that seemingly we, walked into voluntarily </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="714.52" data-end_ts="714.91" title="714.52" id=c_"714.52">__Somali__</span>. It's true. I mean, what's interesting with all these things, I suppose, is where the vulnerability lies is the spaces in
      between. So for us, for example, if I was to send you something in the mail, the vulnerability lies in that process, somewhere in between where somebody opens your mail has a look through it, checks it out, remove something, if they want to, or
      whatever, you know, the same with the internet, we send something to each other that can be intercepted. There used to be a machine that was on sale. I remember seeing that in a shop that would actually intercept faxes. So it's role was
      literally literally to intercept the fax that I sent to you. So I could check it out before it gets to you, which is an extraordinary in a device that somebody invented. But, you know, today we kind of take it for granted that this stuff
      happens, but people don't always consider it, argue against it, you know, but you know, there are factions that do rebel against it and think this is the wrong thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>We do need this private space too. And so, you know, many projects I continue to make do focus on those issues. And there I am talking about making a mask, you know, that actually still reflects those kinds of fascinations because
      the, you know, participating in this part of society is really important. And you have a responsibility as a creative person that's making work publicly. And I still feel that, you know, people can become terribly lethargic about how we respond
      to things in the world. I mean, at this moment in time, no matter what opinion one has about it, it's incredibly thrilling in some senses to see people respond and actually act, you know, my disappointment for years was when I was a student in
      the eighties. I remember we used to go to marches that were called rock against racism. And there were all these kinds of gigs happen in, it was people like Elvis Costello and the specials, and a lot of scar bands and all kinds of things.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And it was incredibly exciting to be part of that in a sense. And for some years I felt that maybe a younger generation didn't have the same commitment, but actually what's been demonstrated to me in recent weeks has been that
      kind of dynamic has been very exciting. Whether, you know, you agree with the stance that people take or not. I think it's incredibly empowering to see people take this on and try and fight against systems that they feel are not right. You
      know, an <span style="color:red" data-ts="840.1" data-end_ts="840.22" title="840.1" id=c_"840.1">__an__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="840.33" data-end_ts="840.55" title="840.33" id=c_"840.33">__an__</span>, an a, not deemed to be
      acceptable today. And so, you know, for many ways, my work is not politicized, but there's, there's those kinds of there's that sensibility that sits behind it still, I don't overtly promote things, but I, what I tried to do is generate ideas,
      I suppose, and get people thinking. So many projects I've made have been about questioning and opening up places for people to think about things a little bit more.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And it's just not always heavily based on things like surveillance and these kinds of things. There are lighter touches obviously, but, you know, in, in collaboration and all manner of ways, you can lead to conversations that
      might otherwise never have happened. And actually just got lead to a point where people get thinking, which is ever so important because people sometimes feel that they don't have a voice, or they can't think about things or share their kind of
      opinions. And for me, I'm interested in other people's opinions. I'm interested in what they may think of. I don't, when I started out, I remember I used to read all the music papers. I used to go to the liquid news agent and flick through the
      magazines, looking for reviews of works of mine and the way that one does. And I haven't done that in years. I kind of lost interest. I thought, okay, everybody has an opinion and let them like it or dislike it. It doesn't really matter, but
      I'm going to continue, you know, fighting my way forward and seeing what you know, where it leaves me.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>So interesting. So interesting. Now there's a whole bunch of stuff there. I want to talk, talk more about, but before we do that, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about their background and how
        they got to be the artists they are. And you dropped a couple of nuggets there in the discussion about, you know, things that were interesting to you when you were younger things that, that you saw and interacted with when you were in college
        and stuff like that. I'm curious, where, where are you coming from? What is it that, you know, what is it that got you, in to be the artists you were, because quite frankly, very early in your, music making career, you were doing things that
        were very avant garde, but also kind of placed or contextualized within a sort of popular form of music. You came around at a time when, techno and raving and that kind of stuff was, a great launching pad for people that were trying something
        new and different. But I'm curious about what was the setup that got you there? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>It's funny, isn't it? I played a show in Brighton in the UK last year, the end of last year, and this fellow came up to me and he said, Hey, Robin, how are you? And I thought, okay, just someone wants to talk to me after the show.
      It turned out, we'd gone to school together from the age of 11. And, you know, I remembered him shortly afterwards, but it was that moment of wow. And he said, I remember when we went to school together, you're always talking about doing all
      these things when you were older and here you are doing them. And I thought, did I really was I really that pretentious? And it was amazing to think because I, one thing that this kind of whole pandemic situation has allowed many people to do
      is kind of, kind of pause for a moment, but also to, to rethink and reevaluate.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And so what it's allowed me to do is work through my archive. So I've got boxes and boxes of cassettes and tapes and reel to reels and CDRs and all manner of things. And I've actually digitized pretty much everything as of
      yesterday, I finished it. And that means there's 850 films of live concerts and interviews. And those kinds of things, there are 60 hours of four track recordings. There are 600 hours of dat tapes. This doesn't mean that any of this is any
      good, I should add. You know, I'm just giving you, I'm just giving you numbers. But basically what it shows is quite remarkable in a way. And I don't mean that to some boastful, but since a very early age, I was playing around with tape
      recorders and not with any ambition of becoming an <span style="color:red" data-ts="1068.91" data-end_ts="1069.68" title="1068.91" id=c_"1068.91">__***<inaudible>***__</span> or anything like that, simply because I could do it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>You know, we had a cheap tape recorder, just a two track tape recorder. You could record something, you could rewind it, you could forward it, you could record over yourself, but you couldn't overdub or anything like that. It
      literally meant all you could do is kind of record what was happening in real time. So my brother used to record the football of television. I would do things like record my score friends I'd record the school bus. I recorded our holidays. So
      we didn't have cameras in those days because they were too expensive. So I used to record our holiday trips. So, you know, sitting on the train, talking to the family and so on, and it's quite remarkable to kind of rediscover those tapes. My
      brother's tapes go back to about 19. He passed away five years ago. So those tapes go back to about 1977.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>So I was 12 years old. And in some ways it's like looking at an amazing photographs. I can remember the sound of those rooms. I can remember the kind of echo of those spaces. And when I was 15 at school, certainly in the UK, we
      used to have what they called careers lessons, and they were fantastic. It basically meant I went to an all boys school. So essentially it meant that a fireman would come in one week or a policeman. And they talked to us for half an hour and
      say, okay, lads, when you're older, you can become a copper like me. And, what we had to do at the end of the kind of session, we had to fill out a form and say what we wanted to do. And so this is a good demonstration that I can still remember
      this. I remember writing on the form and I wrote, it said, what occupation Robin do you wish to follow? And I said, I wish to escape the accretions of contemporary work life.
    </p>

    -----

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>I mean, as <span style="color:red" data-ts="1174.37" data-end_ts="1174.71" title="1174.37" id=c_"1174.37">__seriously__</span>, the word, what we'd say here is what a Winker basically, you know, seriously. And, my school teacher
      just kind of scuffed and said, look, you know, you have to write what you really want to do. So I just wrote journalists, cause my father had been a journalist and I thought, okay, I just do that because it keeps them quiet, but I had no idea,
      but what I knew quite young, what I wanted to do was to work with creative, let's call them things. But not one thing I wanted to be moving in between them because I was going to gigs very young, but I was also going to museums and galleries,
      but I was reading a lot of books. I studied literature at university. So I was kind of interested in all of these kinds of connecting points between the words between the images between the music and music is the one thing that kind of was
      uppermost.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>I suppose, you know, when I got a four track, my English teacher at school, when I was 15, gave me a four track recorder at TEAC. And that allowed me suddenly to move from having just like a mano tape, essentially, which is one
      thing that followed another suddenly I could play with time instead of one thing, following another, or one thing going on top of another or going over something else. Now I could put things on top of each other and suddenly, you know, time
      expanded. I could suddenly do the wildest things I could make tape loops. So I used to do a fun thing. I used to make a long type loop. So a long piece of tape between two bottles and hang a microphone out of my bedroom window and just leave it
      recording. And we lived on a quiet street in London and I literally would record the sound of just somebody walking past or a car or a bicycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And these would build up over hours. And at the end of the day, I'd switch the machine off, go to bed and do the same the next day. And what's funny recently, I just repaired my four track cassette deck. This Fostex two 80 machine
      I had from the eighties and it's full of all my old tape loops. And it's so bizarre to hear, you know, things that are 30 plus years old. Right. And to hear where I was. So in a way, very early on, I'd kind of formulated what I wanted to do,
      but it's not as if I could go to the careers office locally and ask for a job, you know, that sits between the spectrum of sound, music and literature, please, you know, anything like that. But then I was, I was always doing stuff basically and
      have been influenced. I had a good piano teacher or music teacher at school who played us, you know, things like John Cage and Henry cowl and all these kinds of things.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>I had no idea what this was. I was listening to pop music and queen and status quo and thin Lizzy. You know, when I was at a very young boy, because that's what my brother listened to, but I was always interested in the let's call
      it the weird stuff. My mother recommended this dance show on TV and said, I'd really enjoy it because it featured lots of people throwing themselves against the wall. And in fact, it was a work by the German Kroger for peanut Bausch, who then
      of course, I went to see life because I thought, wow, this has to be, you know, exciting that she does this kind of wild work that my mother doesn't approve of. It must be good. What's interesting was exposing myself to dance meant that I went
      to see composers like David Tudor, who was working with John Cage.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And in that way, you know, I met John Cage when I was a teenager and those kinds of moments and those kinds of things are quite pivotal. And at the same time, I was very, very, very interested in visual art. So I went to hear
      people at Joseph Boyce, the German artist talk at the VNA museum in London. I went to see an artist, Stuart bristly, a British artists, give a talk at the ICA in London. So I was extremely active, you know, just kind of no girlfriend, literally
      going out to all these things outside of school. What age are we talking about here? What age were you at? Sort of 16 to 18. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1386.58" data-end_ts="1386.7" title="1386.58" id=c_"1386.58">__That__</span>
      kind of age. So, you know, going, going to see as many of these things as possible and, you know, it's, there was no game plan, so to speak, you know, I had no ambitions of being an inverted commas, famous or successful.

      <b>Robin: </b>What I was interested in was ideas. And I was always interested in the idea of curating ideas and a little bit like your podcast works in a sense, which is to involve a whole different group of people. And each one offers a
      different story in a way, you know, and a different approach. And what I was interested in is it was making things happen that maybe people would be interested in, but more than anything, it was about expressing myself. You know? So I literally
      went to university, studied literature, but I was still making music and I left university and I worked in a bookshop. And then I worked in a music library and I began making works. That became more successful. Like the scan of work when I
      still had a job. And I started to do things like phone in sick to my job.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And the worst moment was once plan at the sonar music festival in Barcelona and return into work, having phoned in sick. And people said, you look well, Robyn. And I thought, Oh, and of course it'd been in Barcelona with extreme
      sun. Yeah. One of those moments. So then I thought maybe it's time to leave. And that was about 25 years ago or so. And you know, so far it's worked. Okay. So I'm always struck that, you know, things continue. I'm really struck. I mean, I've
      never worked with an agent, a live agent, a manager, a record label. I've always been quite fiercely independent. And I enjoy that freedom of being able to slip between the cracks and make these projects happen without having to discuss it with
      anybody. You know, I can make these things happen and think if I can make the time and I want to make it happen and I have the inclination and the enthusiasm, and then let's just do it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, that's actually interesting that you say that because, you know, I'll look behind the curtain for the listeners a little bit. Sometimes the people I interview, I initially get the reach out from a publicist or an agent
        or something like that. In the case of, of Robin in over the years, I've actually had a number of people. Individuals be like, you know, I talked to Robin at, at super booth and he's a really nice guy and you ought to talk to him, you know,
        or, flip a T. That is the person that most recently introduced us. He was like, you just gotta talk because you just have to talk. It's really interesting that this kind of fiercely independent thing also makes you kind of more accessible to
        people in a, in a really unique way. I think it's cool. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>Absolutely. I mean, for me, I've always tried to respond on emails and everything to anybody, even if it's a student writing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1547.28" data-end_ts="1547.37" title="1547.28"
        id=c_"1547.28">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1547.37" data-end_ts="1547.49" title="1547.37" id=c_"1547.37">__me__</span>, I always try my best. If I can, you know, in my experience, there were figures who had great meaning
      for me, you know? And there were people like John Cage. I went to see John Cage every single time he was in London, you know, he'd give a talk. And I remember once being at a talk at the, a meter music festival in London, in the eighties, and
      at the end of the talk, the janitor of the building came in and said, excuse me, you know, started switching off the lights. We have to finish now because the building's closing and Cage said, okay, why don't we we'll go to the pub across the
      road? And we carry on the conversation. And to me, I thought that was absolutely magnificent.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>You know, it wasn't somebody who was just interested in promoting themselves or, or making a living like this. They were genuinely interested in ideas and sharing ideas and engaging in them. And those kind of those moments was so
      pivotal in my upbringing. And so to this day, that's, what's really important that you respond to people and you, you act with great respect and you're, you're very friendly to them as well. There's no, you know, there's always that cliche of
      what is it. They say, you've got to be nice to the people on the way up, because on the way down, they couldn't remember how mean you were. And, you know, I try my best, you know, you try your best to be a good person like we all do. And
      there's no reason to become kind of arrogant or pompous about these things. I simply do what I do.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>It's fine. If you don't like what I do. I mean, I'm not a bad person, but you don't have to like, what, what, what my output is there anything, you know, so it's, it's an, it's, it's a, it's a strange role to be in, as I said, you
      know, at the beginning of the conversation, that kind of freedom and actually just doing things because you want to, can lend themselves to fantastic opportunities that if you were working, let's say with a manager or a publisher, you might
      never have the opportunity because they might judge things upon money. And I've never judged things financially. You know, I've never thought I'm going to do this because they have a big budget or small budget. I do it because I want to, and
      some projects have good budgets, some projects I work on, have no budgets at all, but can live for years and years, you know, all the early work, certainly there was no money to be made in any of that stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And the ambition wasn't to make money. It was simply because I could do it. And I thought maybe somebody would be interested in it. You know, I have no ambitions of setting up a label. I set up this label called Ash international
      with Mike harden, from the British label called touch. And we set this thing up to release, you know, just unusual projects. And I brought to the table, not only the scanner works, but I bought runaway train, which is a recording of a train
      from the early part of last century, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1697.55" data-end_ts="1697.58" title="1697.55" id=c_"1697.55">__a__</span> 27 minute piece of just the communications between the train driver and the headquarters as the
      train gets faster and faster. So it's a bit like the film speed, right. But on a train and it's real. So we did that. We released another record of just airline pilots, communication, just basically over this kind of thing. And you know, it
      it's because you could do it. And I saw them as great art projects as well. I thought, let's, let's see how far we can go with this and, you know, kind of got away with it in a sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right. Well, it's interesting though, because almost more than anyone I've ever interviewed, it sounds to me like you had a real organic move from listening to queen and thin Lizzy to sort of embracing a, Cage like a curiosity
        about the world in the art and art within it. Right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>I'm curious. Curiosity is a good word. Can I say that's a great word to use actually curiosity. I love it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah. And, you know, some of it sounds like prompting from your parents. Some of it sounds like your location and the availability of like going to see John Cage when he was, when he was around, but also sort of a willingness
        to put yourself, put yourself in that position. I think it's something the reason I asked before, about what age was this when you were kind of embedding yourself into some of these things is because a lot of times that 16 through 20 or age
        period is a time where people are like almost grotesquely, self obsessed and, and worried about other people's opinions of them. You know, so all of a sudden it's like, well, I don't want to be the weird guy or else. I want to be the weird
        guy in it. And it's really interesting to me, the way that you just kind of found a way to allow yourself to, to sort of like move in this direction. So it's seemed like a really organic shift. You know, a lot of times when I talk to people,
        it's like, you know, I was just like trucking along listening to queen. And then all of a sudden I heard this, you know, this, Morton Subotnick piece or something. Right. And then that changed everything. Right. It sounds to me like your
        change was sort of almost like over the course of your teens almost. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1841.56" data-end_ts="1841.83" title="1841.56" id=c_"1841.56">__Mm__</span>. I mean, the curious thing is I've kept a diary since I was 12 years old and I've never missed a day. So every single day
      since I was 12 is down on paper. So I can actually go back and I used to write down all the books. I was reading all the films. I saw the exhibitions, the concerts I went to. And so in many ways I can go back and look and see how pretentious I
      was and see what was, what was working, what wasn't working. But it's the organic aspect I've realized has been very true. I mean, I discovered Stockhausen the composer simply by being on a train and coming home one night from a concert or the
      cinema or something. And this fellow in front of me had this huge score open on his lap. And in those days, the trains, the London underground was designed differently and you sat very directly opposite someone.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>Okay. And he opened up this book kind of had no idea what it was and all these colors and shapes. And I just had to say <span style="color:red" data-ts="1893.31" data-end_ts="1893.39" title="1893.31"
        id=c_"1893.31">__know__</span>, I was probably 16 or 17. And can I just ask you what this is? And he said, Oh, it's this. And started talking to me, turned out. He lived across the road from me in South fields, in London, in this small area,
      just on the sort of edge of London. And, it was remarkable. So I used to go and visit him and listen to some of these things, but it was just seeing the physical scores that kind of blew me away actually, of Stockhausen. And there were all
      those kinds of moments. I mean, the funny thing is when my piano teacher at school, when I was 11 played as John Cage prepared piano, my brother and I at home that same day recorded us, hammering the hell out of it, an old standup piano we had
      at home.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>It was all out of tune, you know, much to the frustration. I'm sure my mother, but what's funny is, you know, I have those recordings as well. That's, what's really bizarre. You can have these memories, but I have recordings of
      these things. And then what's really funny. I got very confused because you're 11 years old. I went to the library and thought, Oh, this sounds quite interesting, John Cage let me look him up. I found him John Kao. He was in a band called the
      velvet underground. So then I got a tape out of the velvet underground. I thought, wow, he really rocks John Cage doesn't think you, so I was confused for some time about these two characters, but I worked at at a couple of weeks ago and I've
      worked out the difference. So it took a few years, but
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>That's hilarious. Well, but yeah. Talk about an interesting way to sort of like branch into new listening and in new brain spaces. Right. It's great. Yeah. Yeah. Speaking of personal education, now, you said that you studied
        literature in college. How did, why, why would you have chosen <span style="color:red" data-ts="1987.1" data-end_ts="1987.16" title="1987.1" id=c_"1987.1">__a__</span> literature is very of study. And how did, how do you feel like that
        actually informed your art practice? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>Interesting. I mean, I think, you know, if I, if I jumped to the end of that in a way, what I realized I enjoyed most about it was the fact that it taught me how to, how to critique something. I know when I was, when I was
      younger, before I went to university, if you and I went to the cinema, we'd walk out at the end and I'd kind of look at you and you'd look at me and we kind of shrug our shoulders and go, and I'd kind of wait you to say, wasn't it great or
      wasn't it terrible? You know, but what I learned at university was actually I could have an opinion and I could, you know, it would, it would help me kind of be able to voice my own argument, but to go back to the beginning, language has always
      interested me in words.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And I was always a huge reader. And so what's interesting is I failed to get into university and the first year, and so I took a year off and what that meant is I took not private classes, but I took kind of evening classes and
      day classes in local kind of colleges and studied all these books. So I spent the summer reading things like here I am sort of 18 years old reading James, James Joyce's, Ulysses and Hemingway and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2058.43"
        data-end_ts="2058.97" title="2058.43" id=c_"2058.43">__burrows__</span> and all kinds of things. And I found a course in London, a university course that actually was modern literature because I wasn't necessarily interested in historical
      literature. I wanted to read and, and kind of things that resonated with who I was and the world around me at this moment. Right? So I found this amazing course, which turned out it was in a place called Kingston, which in subsequent years, I
      bumped into so many people like Richard James, a fixed twin who also studied in Kingston.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And he suddenly realized there was this incredible kind of vibrant activity going on in this area, this very kind of quiet, localized area of London. But in fact there was all this kind of stuff happening and, you know, literature
      always fascinated me. I still have all those books from that period. From the earliest age, I was reading lots of poetry, books and Chaucer and Shakespeare and Beckett and all kinds of things. And to this day, I still have a ridiculous book
      collection. I still buy an absurd amount of books. I will never be able to read them all, but that doesn't matter. You know, I take joy in just looking at these things sometimes, but, you know, literature, it was always really important to me.
      And when I studied modern literature, it meant I was actually reading books that were written 30 or 40 years ago and actually had a relevance to a city I could visit.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>Or I knew of some of the names of the places they actually had. Great more meaning to me than reading a romantic novel from 250 ago, although that obviously had a value in the things I studied. So, how they lended themselves. So
      what I was doing, I can't offer like a clear lineage in a sense, but I certainly know when I was at college, I recorded phenomenal amounts of work. In fact, that's lots of work. I just recently imported. And in the space of about three years at
      university, I think I recorded the equivalent of about eight or nine albums of music. Again, none of that is necessarily any good, but it was done and it was achieved, you know, and it's, it's really interesting when you bump into university
      friends and they, you know, they follow me on social networks and it's really quite sweet when they say, Oh, I remember being really impressed when you were at college and you were doing all these things.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And I just literally came across a flyer the other day, over a concert I put on when I was about 19 years old. And I still to this day, can't believe that I was living at home with my family. And I caught up an art gallery in
      London and I booked it as a private booking. And then I hired a PA system and then I advertised it and made flyers and took the flyers to shops. And so tickets and then had a concert, you know, it was 19 years old. It's just absolutely
      ridiculous. But you know, it was a little bit fearless at that time. I was terribly shy, but also fearless in a way, you know, and I, I remember at the time bumping into the director, Derek Jarman a lot, an amazing fair figure, this British
      film director. And, he was a big influence on me for more than anything because of his kind of collaborative approach, his films weren't only made by him.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>I recognized they were made by a team of people around him. And I got to know lots of the people around him. And to this day, I'm still friends with quite a lot of the people that worked with Jarman. And, you know, when I had
      figures like Jarman out there and Cage and Joseph <span style="color:red" data-ts="2236.5" data-end_ts="2236.77" title="2236.5" id=c_"2236.5">__boys__</span> talking about his kind of ideas of social sculpture that were very invigorating to a
      young man wanting to make things happen. You know, these were figures who were in my eyes, very successful, you know, they were, they were kind of, you know, heroes and yet they were all accessible in a way they all weren't that far away.
      Certainly to this day, friends of mine have told me stories about going to New York, finding John Cage his phone number in the phone book, calling him up, going around to visit him and him answering the doorbell and, you know, coming in for a
      drink. And you think this is just remarkable. You wouldn't have this today. You feel like with most of the people, you know, you may listen to or read their books or anything, you know, you keep a clear distance sometimes for good reason.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah. So true. Yeah. Well, it's interesting that German was, such an influence. Recently I interviewed Simon Fisher Turner, who also, you know, has worked with him a lot and also talked about the incredible influences. It's
        one of those names that I hadn't heard a lot before that all of a sudden this cropping up is as like this influential, not just his work, but as a person has, has become kind of very quietly, very influential to a lot of people. </i>
    </p>

    -----

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>No, it's very important figure. I mean, particularly in the, in the kind of gay scene at the, at the time, but also in terms of the, the, the, the body of work. I, I used to go on a Sunday to a place called the diorama's in
      London, near Regents park, and this extraordinary building, which was a kind of precursor to cinema the dire <span style="color:red" data-ts="2324.47" data-end_ts="2324.83" title="2324.47" id=c_"2324.47">__Arma__</span>. And I used to go there
      on a Sunday afternoon and Michael nine would, would play the piano and Jarman would show his films and all kinds of people would come along and do performances and all sorts of things. And it probably costs something like two or three pounds to
      get in. And I met so many people to music and it was, it was fantastic. I mean, you know, I, I know, you know, Michael Nyman from those days, I know lots of the people and there I was probably 18, 19, 20 years old.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And I used to go every Sunday. And to me, it was really magical. You know, these were people who were making culture happen, but they weren't doing it from a big stage. They were doing it in a local way. They were often very
      poorly funded if funded at all and making it themselves. And that was a huge inspiration realizing you don't need the mechanisms a bit like punk, you know, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2370.28" data-end_ts="2370.64" title="2370.28"
        id=c_"2370.28">__tortoise__</span>, you don't need the mechanisms of a record company or anything. I learned quite early that one can actually make these things happen. You know, themselves, you can do it. If you have the energy and you save
      your money, you can make these things happen in some ways, or you can do it with no money. Sometimes
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Boy, there's so many things I want to talk about, but there's one thing in specific, I kind of warned you ahead of time, that I wanted to talk about this. And it's sort of like, as you went from kind of doing composition with
        these phone sounds, and then you, you kind of like delve more into what we would think of as traditional musical work. Right. And this is kind of the direction, I would say that your, your work has gone. There's one piece though, I am
        obsessed with talking to people about their experiences with peculiar compositional opportunities. And, what's interesting is several of the people that you just talked about here that you met, found themselves in a position, whether it's
        doing music for film or making film to, to match music or all these kinds of things. This sort of like, movement into peculiar opportunities seems to be something that, is part of the life of the people that you surrounded yourself with and
        you, and you have taken that, the opportunity to, to follow some of these tracks. One that really caught my attention is, something that's related to, something called the vex house. And you actually did a release called VAX, which was a
        gorgeous sounding release. But, this idea of having of getting a commission to do composition work for a building, it's kind of that peculiar twist of fate that I'm curious about, first of all, how did the opportunity come up? And secondly,
        it's such as a conceptually bizarre idea. I'm curious what it is that was your thought process going into making a composition for a building. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2513.98" data-end_ts="2514.31" title="2513.98" id=c_"2513.98">__Mm__</span>. It was a strange story actually. And it begins with failure, which is always interesting because failure is something
      that people don't always want to talk about, but it can play a key role in the, in the makeup of your, you know, your, your life. And I was working on what I put a proposal through. Actually, I don't know how it came about, but I put a proposal
      forward to a public art commission. And it was a suggestion for ideas in hospitals and public spaces. Now, just to give it a context, I have a permanent work in a morgue, in, in a place called gosh, just outside of Paris in France. And it's a
      permanent work that lives in the morgue space designed by an Italian architect called <span style="color:red" data-ts="2555.83" data-end_ts="2556.97" title="2555.83" id=c_"2555.83">__***<inaudible>***__</span> and that workplace permanently,
      and it lives there. And the idea of that, I've just given you a context.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>The idea that work is to offer kind of solace and peace to those who are trying to deal with the death of a loved one, which has just happened so far that work had happened. And I saw another opportunity some years later for using
      sound. And so I suggested about working on a project that was looking at reducing violence in hospital waiting rooms, and it was working with sound and architecture. And an architect was suggested to me through a friend and we put the, put the
      proposal through and it was rejected. And the commissioners weren't interested in the least in the least, but I stayed in touch with her. And I thought it was a strong idea. I thought there's really something to be made of a work that helps in
      this environment, because there were so many issues of violence in waiting rooms and emergency rooms anywhere it never ever happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And we stayed in touch sort of vaguely over the years. And it turned out that she and her partner who called themselves chance to silver are a really interesting architectural practice based in London. They work on not many
      projects. I mean, literally, probably half a dozen in total, I suppose it's quite common with architects that they have a large body of work that isn't genuinely built. You know, it takes so long to get plant planning, permission to everything,
      but they came to me quite early on and they said, look, we were working on a building in London and we think it might intrigue you. And we'd like to collaborate because we work with stained glass artists. We previously worked with a dancer. We
      worked with a photographer, but this time we'd like to work with sound and you're free to do whatever you want, which is always a bit scary because it's quite helpful when people give you parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>Cause then you can think, okay, I worked within that. So how do you start? I have no idea. What's interesting. We had conversation and it turned out that both Steve, the architect, Steve chance, and Wendy, the silver Steve,
      particularly is a musician. I'm very interested in kind of composers lights, the Nexis and Stockhausen and Cage, but was very interested in Erik salty. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2687.25" data-end_ts="2687.64" title="2687.25"
        id=c_"2687.25">__Sati__</span> has been one of those figures who I've always enjoyed his work. So I mean, you know, people are very familiar with Sati is the kind of relatively light, light, playful piano pieces. But you know, some of his
      works were just magnificent. The furniture piece. For example, if you, if you know, it was really a very important work that isn't spoken about enough that, you know, it was the kind of first in a sense, arguably the first ambient piece, a
      piece of music that you needed to ignore rather than listen to yes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And a Sati isn't eccentric, you know, the stories about him that he had two pianos in his apartment and one was filled with an open letters. He had a collection of velvet, identical velvet suits. I mean, they're just kind of
      endless the stories, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2726.25" data-end_ts="2726.43" title="2726.25" id=c_"2726.25">__these__</span> so intriguing. He wrote a piece of music called vexations, which is a kind of early serial pieces. It's a very
      simple score, but it runs for 18 hours when it's performed in four. And always remember the story that when it was first performed, it was never performed during his lifetime really. But John Cage was one of the figures who was a great
      enthusiast for Sati. And he produced with friends the first performance of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2753.87" data-end_ts="2754.48" title="2753.87" id=c_"2753.87">__vexations__</span>. And I love the story that basically said that, the,
      the, every for every hour you stayed for the performance, you've got something like another 20 cents back of your, of your entry fee.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And at the end of the 18 hour performance, somebody in the audience shouted our Encore, which I thought was a great sense of humor as well. But, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's a simple piece, but it's a kind of circular piece.
      And we both loved this piece of music and they have this quite brilliant idea that they were going to build a house in London based on the sheet music of excitations. So what they did was took the site, this kind of what was actually a former
      car park in London, dropped the notes around the shape of the building they had in mind, this kind of strange kind of curved concrete. It's very difficult to describe it. I always try and describe it as a little bit like two or three toilet
      rolls balanced on top of each other. You know, it has a kind of egg shape to it.

      <b>Robin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2811.36" data-end_ts="2811.48" title="2811.36" id=c_"2811.36">__There's__</span> kind of weird shifted angles, but what they did was took the sheet music and wrapped it around this, this model,
      this MCAT and where the notes fill are, where the windows are in the building, and you can find photographs of it online. And it's remarkable to look at, cause you realize they are in odd places, the windows they're kind of too high to look
      through or they're too low, but actually they are where the notes fell on the piece of music. And it's an extraordinary work just physically to see. I mean, it's, it's in a street to very kind of standard architectural British architectural
      houses and kind of the turn of last century. And suddenly you have this very kind of modernist white, gray building standing there. This kind of corrugated steel sheeting was used to construct it. And what I did because I had no ideas what to
      do. I went along during the different parts of the construction and would record there. What I discovered one day in the recording was in fact, the machine that was pouring in the concrete to, to build the walls in between these sheets of
      corrugated steel was in fact in something like F sharp. And I thought, wow, you can <span style="color:red" data-ts="2876.29" data-end_ts="2876.44" title="2876.29" id=c_"2876.29">__go__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2876.44"

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Nice.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And you could hum along to it. And that's actually how the piece began. We had a discussion of before it was physically finished, the building that the audio has to be a permanent piece. It needs to be embedded in the building
      itself. So we installed a sound system within the frame of the building. It's actually sealed in the concrete. When I, when I tell this to some people I need to make it clear, you can switch it off. I mean, honestly, nobody wants to live there
      listening to my piece for 24 hours, not even me, but you know, essentially, you know, the piece of music is a continuous loop. And so the building and itself is a continuous loop and you have these kind of three floors and they each have
      speakers in and the music plays through each of them and they kind of wrap around each other, the music and the architecture wrap around each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And, it's been a huge success in terms of what it's offered in a sense each year. There's a kind of open architecture weekend in London and every year, just over a weekend, about a thousand people go through the building to have a
      look at it. You know, it's wonderful to have worked on something that actually, you know, appeals in such a, in such a wide way, even appeared on a grand designs, TV show, which is a very popular British TV show about house design. And it was
      up for house of the year. I mean, there was no way it was going to win, but it was such a joy to be on a very popular TV show. And they came here to the studio and they interviewed me and we spoke about music concrete and all kinds of things.
      And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2962.08" data-end_ts="2962.16" title="2962.08" id=c_"2962.08">__know__</span> that is an opportunity in itself was quite fantastic.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>That was really stimulating, you know, to make a kind of sculptural work that lives there permanently. And the fact that there's a family lifts there. I mean, so far two different families have lived there and to make a permanent
      work in the city of London that is radically, you know, challenging to the eye and to the ear is quite remarkable. You know, I think, you know, if Satie were around today, I think he'd have been very proud of it, to be honest. It's one of those
      things we would have probably thought, yes, that's the, that's the kind of quirky individuals I need out there. So, yeah, in essence, you know, we never knew where it was going to go to, I had no ideas what the piece was actually going to be
      when I, we made a very early version of it as a kind of demo and showed it the, architectural pavilion in Venice.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And then it was a very different piece completely. And it kind of led in its own way. And when I actually put the work <span style="color:red" data-ts="3013.11" data-end_ts="3013.29" title="3013.11" id=c_"3013.11">__onto__</span>
      band camp, eventually I made a work which is inspired by and UCA. I sort of followed his, I'm sitting in a room listening, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I made a work where I played the soundtrack. I made back into the building and I recorded
      that piece back into the, into the recorder, then played it back into the building. And after about 12 iterations, essentially all you were hearing with the resonant frequencies of the building and, you know, within eight to 10 kind of repeats
      that the building itself had devoured the music. And I love the idea of, you know, the architecture kind of eating the music in a sense. So it's been a hugely exciting projects we've worked on. And to this day, I mean, you, you talk to me now
      about it. It's one of those things that actually, it's a great conversation piece, but it's, it's great when you bump into people who live in the area and suddenly go, that was you, you kind of hoping that it's in a good way, you know, when
      they <span style="color:red" data-ts="3066.35" data-end_ts="3066.54" title="3066.35" id=c_"3066.35">__spend__</span> they point at you and go, it was you, you kind of duck duck in case the fist swings in the air or something, <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="3072.35" data-end_ts="3072.56" title="3072.35" id=c_"3072.35">__but__</span> it's a fantastic project.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah. What a beautiful story though. That's, that's amazing. And again, what, what a career you've made for yourself to be able to find yourself in the position to do that kind of stuff. I think that's fantastic. And, and hats
        off to you for, for, for doing that and for putting, for sort of like sticking with the programs so that you could get to that place. Right. Cause I'm sure over the course of your career, there were a lot of cases where you could have just
        said, all right, I'm just going to go to Hollywood and I'm just going to start a TV show, you know, music or, Oh, okay. Well, you know, somebody wants me to become a sound designer for games or something, and you're going to disappear into
        that world, but it just seems like you've kind of embraced the direction that you chose to go and you stuck with it. And I I'm really appreciative of that. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>Thank you. I'm going to have, I've had opportunities like that come to me and actually I don't enjoy them. I realized, you know, the last time I toured as such as a touring artist was 2001. I took it across America. I played 21
      shows in 22 days, started over in, I think I started in Mexico city, but then I went from kind of LA and Seattle right across to New York. And by the time of arriving in New York, three weeks later, I remember sitting on the steps outside the
      building, just off Broadway and feeling so depressed and just no energy left. And I didn't know what to do. And I always just wanted to cry. And then chances were that I bumped into a friend and who's happened to be by as a theater director.
      And he was actually working in New York and he said to me, so how are you Robin?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>I said, well, I told him, I'm not really enjoying this. He said, so why you doing it? And I thought, you know, I'd never asked myself that question because it's something that you do. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="3182.22"
        data-end_ts="3182.28" title="3182.22" id=c_"3182.22">__the__</span>, in our lives, often we follow certain patterns because that's how you do it. And it wasn't until that moment that somebody questioned me and I began questioning myself and I
      thought, you know, I'm never going to do that again. And since then, I've never followed that thing. I mean, the thing I generally say no to most live concerts because I just, I don't see for myself anything, I can really offer that much, you
      know, and it's quite a challenge to kind of work them out. And the idea of physically traveling doesn't necessarily appeal to me. Right? So, in some ways the pandemic has been great like that it's forced me at home and I've quite enjoyed that
      aspect.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>You know, that sounds cruel, but you know, I tried to find the positive out of the negative, but you know, what I've done largely is take risks in my career. You know, I've, I've taken on things which could be huge failures and
      sometimes are huge failures. But I try not to talk about those too much. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3231.54" data-end_ts="3231.72" title="3231.54" id=c_"3231.54">__No__</span>, but I I've taken risks. And most times they work out, you
      know, and most times what you end up doing is making good friends. I mean, genuinely the people I work with in collaborations like that turn into good powers, you know, and to me, that's, what's really important. You know, the life is far too
      short to kind of use bad energy up and be, you know, frustrated and fed up with the music industry, the art industry, whatever it may be, I try and embrace these opportunities and make the best of them, you know, and try and remain positive
      through them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, that's fantastic. And I hope that the listeners get a chance to sort of digest that and, and find a way to embrace that. Because I think that that's actually the way to make a kind of holistic and joyful life. I really
        appreciate the way that you've expressed that. And, and for your sharing, I want to thank you so much for that. Okay. Well, unfortunately our time is up. It's well up, but it's okay because, and I still have like two sheets of paper and stuff
        I wish we could talk about. So we're going to have to have a part two at some point. But in the meantime, what have you got? I have one last question, which is what is on your, like your, your laboratory table right now that you you're
        working on, maybe that's about ready to go or, or something that, is kind of like obsessing, you are occupying your brain right now. Where, where are you at right now? Right. This moment, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>I am actually trying to work through the archive in a very direct way. I'm trying to, I set up a kind of band camp band camp fan club in the absence of any real income. So what I've been doing actually is, is literally digging
      into the archive and exploring it and remastering it and actually offering it out. So that's been great to kind of a kind of rediscovery of my own past, you know, that's what sort of sit in there as a kind of constant at this moment. I, you
      know, I, what I found is quite remarkable. I found that I'm just as busy now than I've ever been. You know, even with the cancellation of lots of work, I seem to be exceptionally busy. I set up a lot of different projects. I have a lot of
      recording coming out. I've been super active with that, but also I suppose, you know, the most significant thing I've set up, I set up an art foundation, which means when I'm no longer around the building I live in here and my savings and my
      studio and my books and my archive and my record collection all goes to the foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Robin: </b>And to me, that's kind of the constant. It means that when I'm no longer around what I can at least do is offer to other younger people to make their work and create, be them visual artists or photographers, writers, poets,
      musicians, whatever. And to me, that's a kind of constant, you know, it's, it's about making something that's beyond me is really, really important. You know, in the last five years I lost all my family. There's none of those memories left. And
      I wanted to make sure without having any children of my own, that I can offer something at least back, you know, positively. So this is all set up officially now. So this is an encouraging, like a Hitman to get me next week or something, so
      they can get access to all this stuff I have to be careful about. Yeah. I do have two body guards now. Obviously one has to be careful, but yeah, that's kind of taken up my time, but I like to be a busy boy, so that's good
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right on, well, Robin, I want to thank you so much for taking the time out of your schedule and, for having this, talk it again. We are going to pick this up with another conversation at some point, but in the meantime, I want
        to thank you for the time and, and let you have the rest of your day. </i>

      <b>Robin: </b>Absolute pleasure. Thank you. Thank you. Bye now.
